[{"t":["rtw"],"a":"kyleobrien","n":"Optional weekend reading:\r\n\r\n> To get a better feel for their work, I called on Steven Witherly, a food scientist who wrote a fascinating guide for industry insiders titled, “Why Humans Like Junk Food.” I brought him two shopping bags filled with a variety of chips to taste. He zeroed right in on the Cheetos. “This,” Witherly said, “is one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.” He ticked off a dozen attributes of the Cheetos that make the brain say more. But the one he focused on most was the puff’s uncanny ability to melt in the mouth. “It’s called vanishing caloric density,” Witherly said. “If something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.”","d":"The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food","u":"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all&","dt":"2013-03-03T05:49:29Z"},{"t":["rtw"],"a":"kyleobrien","n":"The smartest thing I've read in months.","d":"Corporations as Hostile AI","u":"http://mini.quietbabylon.com/post/44276219648/the-singularity-already-happened-we-got-corporations","dt":"2013-03-03T05:53:47Z"},{"t":["rtw"],"a":"kyleobrien","n":"Now featuring obligatory \"guy in banana suit\".","d":"FAA investigating \"Harlem Shake\" on Plane","u":"http://boingboing.net/2013/03/01/faa-investigating-harlem-sha.html","dt":"2013-03-03T22:38:10Z"}]
